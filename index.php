A <i>finite-state machine</i> is a mathematical model of computation.
It is an abstract machine that can be in
exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.
The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs;
the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a
list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition. Finite
state machines are of two types â€“ deterministic finite state machines and
non-deterministic finite state machines. A <i>deterministic finite-state
machine</i> can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one.
